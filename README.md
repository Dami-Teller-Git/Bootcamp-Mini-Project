# Project Background Overview
This project is a command-line software application designed for a pop-up café in a busy business district. The application helps manage and track orders, products, and couriers. It provides users with a menu-driven interface to manage product catalogs, view and create orders, and manage courier services efficiently.

# Client Requirements
The client requested a software solution that:

Maintains a collection of products and couriers.

Allows the creation and updating of orders, including order status (e.g., preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered).

Ensures data persistence so that data is saved and loaded upon each program start.

Supports a simple and clear user interface, with options to return to the main menu or exit.

Handles invalid input gracefully and is robust enough to avoid errors during operation.

  # Technical specificiations
The application runs via the command-line interface (CLI).

The UI is simple and intuitive, offering a menu system with options to manage products, orders, and couriers.

Initially, data is stored in plain text files, with plans to migrate to CSV and eventually SQL for better scalability.

The system is built to handle invalid input and provide a smooth user experience.

  # Core Features
 Main Menu: A central hub for navigating to the products, orders, and couriers menus.

Product Management: Options to view, add, update, and delete products.

Order Management: Create new orders, update order status, and delete orders.

Courier Management: Add, update, and remove couriers.

Data Persistence: Ensures all data is saved and loaded on app startup and exit.

Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid user inputs.

# How to run the application
Open the project in a code editor like Visual Studio Code.

Open the terminal and run the script.

The program will present a main menu with the following options:

1: Products Menu (Manage products)

2: Orders Menu (Manage orders)

3: Couriers Menu (Manage couriers)

0: Exit the program

# Testing 
I conducted thorough testing to ensure the robustness of the application. This included testing:

Handling invalid input

Proper functionality of each menu and option

# Improvements for the Future
If I had more time, I would focus on:

Migrating data storage to CSV files and eventually SQL for better scalability.

Enhancing the testing coverage to include edge cases and performance tests.

Streamlining the user interface and making the menus more user-friendly.

# Reflection
I enjoyed implementing the core features of the application, especially the functions that handle order creation, status updates, and managing product inventories. Functions were initially challenging, but as I gained a deeper understanding, they became one of the most rewarding aspects of the project. In the future, I’d aim to implement unit tests and data persistence to ensure my code is more efficient and robust for use.
